You are an expert full-stack developer and Google AdSense policy consultant.

You are working in a Replit project that powers:

  https://strongpasswordgenerator.dev/

The goal is to:
1) KEEP the existing functionality (password generator, passphrase generator, password strength checker, FAQ, guides, contact).
2) INTEGRATE the rich text content I provide in `/content/*.html` so that every important page has substantial, unique content.
3) PREPARE the site for Google AdSense Auto Ads using my real publisher ID:
      ca-pub-6175161566333696
   while respecting AdSense policies about:
   - “Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content”
   - “Low value content”

You should assume that Auto Ads will be turned on in the AdSense UI. Your job is to:
- Add the correct global Auto Ads script in the layout.
- Remove any old/manual page-level AdSense snippets (if present).
- Ensure the site looks finished, content-rich, and policy-compliant so Auto Ads placements are on strong pages.

--------------------------------------------------
CONTENT PARTIALS (ALREADY PROVIDED BY ME)
--------------------------------------------------

Assume I have created a `/content` folder containing HTML partials with the main body content (sections, headings, paragraphs) for each page:

- /content/home-main.html
- /content/passphrases-main.html
- /content/strength-checker-main.html
- /content/guides-hub.html
- /content/guide-strong-passwords.html
- /content/guide-password-managers.html
- /content/guide-upgrading-passwords.html
- /content/guide-mfa.html
- /content/faq.html
- /content/about.html
- /content/privacy.html
- /content/terms.html
- /content/contact.html

Each partial contains well-structured HTML (<section>, <h2>, etc.) but not a full page shell.

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT rewrite or shorten these partials.
- Only wrap them in the site layout and adjust heading levels if necessary for semantic correctness.

--------------------------------------------------
SITE STRUCTURE & ROUTES
--------------------------------------------------

Inspect the existing project and identify the best place to define a shared layout (e.g., base template, root HTML, or layout component). If the project is plain static HTML, create a simple consistent pattern.

Create/update pages so that the site exposes at least these routes:

1) Home: /
   - Title: "Secure Password Generator | StrongPasswordGenerator.dev"
   - Contains:
     * The existing password generator UI/logic (keep functionality intact; you may refactor for clarity).
     * The HTML from /content/home-main.html included below or alongside the generator.
   - Ensure generation is 100% client-side and uses secure randomness (window.crypto.getRandomValues). Add comments explaining that passwords are never sent to a server.

2) Passphrases: /passphrases
   - Title: "Passphrase Generator | StrongPasswordGenerator.dev"
   - Contains:
     * A passphrase generator UI, if not already present (options: number of words, separator, capitalization).
     * The HTML from /content/passphrases-main.html.
   - Passphrases must be generated with secure randomness and must not be logged or sent to a backend.

3) Strength Checker: /strength-checker
   - Title: "Password Strength Checker | StrongPasswordGenerator.dev"
   - Contains:
     * The existing strength checker UI/logic.
     * The HTML from /content/strength-checker-main.html.

4) Guides hub: /guides
   - Title: "Guides & Resources | StrongPasswordGenerator.dev"
   - Includes the HTML from /content/guides-hub.html and internal links to the guide detail pages below.

5) Guide detail pages:
   - /guides/strong-passwords-and-passphrases -> /content/guide-strong-passwords.html
   - /guides/password-managers              -> /content/guide-password-managers.html
   - /guides/upgrading-old-passwords        -> /content/guide-upgrading-passwords.html
   - /guides/multi-factor-authentication    -> /content/guide-mfa.html

6) FAQ:     /faq     -> /content/faq.html
7) About:   /about   -> /content/about.html
8) Privacy: /privacy -> /content/privacy.html
9) Terms:   /terms   -> /content/terms.html
10) Contact:/contact -> /content/contact.html

Use whatever routing/templating system the project already has (static HTML, templating engine, or minimal framework). The key is that each route renders the shared layout plus the appropriate content partial.

--------------------------------------------------
LAYOUT, NAVIGATION, FOOTER
--------------------------------------------------

Create a shared layout used by all pages:

- <header> with a <nav> that links to:
  Home (/)
  Passphrases (/passphrases)
  Strength Checker (/strength-checker)
  Guides (/guides)
  FAQ (/faq)
  About (/about)
  Privacy (/privacy)
  Terms (/terms)
  Contact (/contact)

- <main> where you inject the page-specific content partial, and where any existing tool UI (generator / checker) appears.

- <footer> that includes:
  - A copyright line.
  - Links to About, Guides, Privacy, Terms, Contact.

Use semantic HTML and responsive design:
- Only one <h1> per page.
- Logical <h2>/<h3> hierarchy for sections.
- Ensure pages render well on mobile and desktop (no horizontal scrolling on narrow screens).

--------------------------------------------------
ADSENSE AUTO ADS INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------------------

We are using **Auto Ads**, not manual ad units.

1) In the shared layout’s <head> (so it is included on every page), add the standard Auto Ads script with my real publisher ID:

   <!-- Google AdSense Auto Ads -->
   <script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-6175161566333696"
           crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

   This is the only AdSense script we need for Auto Ads.

2) Remove any old/manual AdSense code if present, including:
   - Any <ins class="adsbygoogle"> blocks with data-ad-client / data-ad-slot.
   - Any JS snippets like:
       (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({ google_ad_client: "...", enable_page_level_ads: true });
   We want a clean Auto Ads setup powered solely by the script above.

3) Do NOT add any manual ad units in the codebase. Auto Ads will handle placement once enabled in the AdSense UI.

4) For policy compliance:
   - Ensure all main pages (Home, Passphrases, Strength Checker, Guides, FAQ, About, Privacy, Terms, Contact) are content-rich and look “finished”.
   - There must be clearly more publisher content than ads on every page. Since Auto Ads is controlled from the AdSense dashboard, you do NOT need to add any extra markup here; just ensure that each page has substantial, unique content and is not “just a blank tool”.

5) If there are very thin or experimental pages, either:
   - Remove them from public navigation, or
   - Make sure they are noindexed / not part of the main structure.
   I will handle fine-grained page-level exclusions directly in the AdSense UI (Ads → By site → Edit → Page exclusions) if needed.

--------------------------------------------------
PRIVACY, TERMS & TRUST
--------------------------------------------------

Use the partials:

- /content/privacy.html for the /privacy route.
- /content/terms.html   for the /terms route.

Make sure:
- The Privacy Policy clearly states that passwords and passphrases are generated and checked client-side and not stored or logged.
- It also acknowledges that analytics and advertising (including Google AdSense Auto Ads) may set cookies and collect usage data in line with their own policies.

Ensure the footer links to Privacy and Terms on every page.

--------------------------------------------------
TECHNICAL & SEO DETAILS
--------------------------------------------------

1) For each page, set appropriate <title> and <meta name="description"> tags that match the page content.

2) Create or update:
   - /sitemap.xml including all primary URLs:
       /, /passphrases, /strength-checker, /guides,
       /guides/strong-passwords-and-passphrases,
       /guides/password-managers,
       /guides/upgrading-old-passwords,
       /guides/multi-factor-authentication,
       /faq, /about, /privacy, /terms, /contact
   - /robots.txt that allows normal crawling and optionally references the sitemap.

3) Fix any console errors or obvious JavaScript issues.

4) Keep CSS/JS organized (e.g., /css/main.css, /js/generator.js, /js/passphrases.js, /js/strength-checker.js) and add comments where appropriate, especially:
   - Mention that password generation and checking are done client-side and never transmitted.

--------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------

When you are done, output a concise summary that lists:

1) All files created or modified (with paths).
2) A brief description of the routing/layout structure.
3) A short explanation (3–5 bullets) of how the updated site addresses:
   - "Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content"
   - "Low value content"

Do not rewrite or shorten the textual content in /content/*.html; focus on layout, routing, Auto Ads integration with ca-pub-6175161566333696, and policy-compliant structure.
