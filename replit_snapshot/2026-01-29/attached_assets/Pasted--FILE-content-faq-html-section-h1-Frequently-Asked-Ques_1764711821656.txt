  <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  <p>
    Here are answers to common questions about StrongPasswordGenerator.dev, how it works, and how to use it safely.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Do you store or see my passwords?</h2>
  <p>
    No. Passwords and passphrases are generated and analyzed entirely in your browser. They are not sent to our servers, logged, or stored.
    If you refresh or close the page, the values disappear.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Is this site free to use?</h2>
  <p>
    Yes. The password generator, passphrase generator, strength checker, and guides are free to use for personal and educational purposes.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>How random are the passwords?</h2>
  <p>
    The generator uses modern browser cryptography features (such as <code>window.crypto.getRandomValues</code>) to create random values,
    which are then mapped to characters. This provides much stronger randomness than simple math-based random functions.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Can I use these passwords at work?</h2>
  <p>
    In many cases, yes, but you should follow your organization’s security policies. Some companies require specific password lengths
    or character types. Our generator lets you adjust options to match those rules.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What if a website does not allow symbols or long passwords?</h2>
  <p>
    Some older systems have strict limits. In those cases, use the longest length the site supports and mix uppercase, lowercase, and numbers.
    You may also want to enable multi-factor authentication if available.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Why do you recommend a password manager?</h2>
  <p>
    Password managers make it practical to use a different strong password for every account. Without one, people tend to reuse or simplify passwords,
    which weakens security. See our <a href="/guides/password-managers">Password Managers guide</a> for details.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Can I share generated passwords with family members?</h2>
  <p>
    You should only share passwords in a secure way, ideally using a password manager that supports family sharing. Avoid sending passwords through
    email, text messages, or messaging apps unless you have no better option and trust the channel.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What should I do if I think a password has been leaked?</h2>
  <p>
    Change it as soon as possible, using a new, strong password. If you reused the same password on other sites, change those as well.
    Turn on multi-factor authentication and watch for unusual account activity.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Does using a generator guarantee I can never be hacked?</h2>
  <p>
    No tool can offer a guarantee. Strong passwords significantly reduce the risk of direct password guessing, but other factors—such as phishing,
    malware, or website breaches—also matter. Use strong passwords together with good overall security habits.
