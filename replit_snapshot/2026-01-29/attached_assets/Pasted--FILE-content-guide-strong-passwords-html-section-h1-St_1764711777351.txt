  <h1>Strong Passwords &amp; Passphrases: A Friendly Guide</h1>
  <p>
    Passwords are one of the oldest and most important pieces of online security. They protect your email, banking, photos,
    and more. The good news is that you do not need to become a security professional to use passwords safely. A handful of
    simple habits goes a long way.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Why Weak Passwords Are a Problem</h2>
  <p>
    Attackers rarely sit and guess passwords by hand. Instead, they use automated tools that can try millions or billions of
    guesses, often starting with the most common passwords, dictionary words, and simple patterns. Short or predictable passwords
    fall quickly to these methods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data breaches also leak usernames and passwords from one site, which attackers then try on other sites. If you reuse the
    same password across multiple accounts, one breach can put many accounts at risk.

  <h2>The Three Rules of Strong Passwords</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Make them long.</strong> Aim for at least 12 characters, and use 16 or more when you can.</li>
    <li><strong>Make them random.</strong> Avoid words, names, dates, and predictable patterns.</li>
    <li><strong>Make them unique.</strong> Use a different password for every important account.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    When these three rules are followed, attackers have to work much harder. Brute-forcing truly random, long passwords is
    computationally expensive and often unrealistic.

  <h2>Using a Password Generator</h2>
  <p>
    Creating strong passwords by hand is difficult. That is why StrongPasswordGenerator.dev exists. A generator can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use secure randomness to create unpredictable passwords.</li>
    <li>Quickly create different passwords for every site.</li>
    <li>Help you meet specific requirements (length, symbols, etc.).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Because our generator runs entirely in your browser, you get the benefits of randomness without sending passwords over the
    network. For most people, this is far safer than trying to design passwords manually.
  </p>

  <h2>Passphrases: Long but Memorable</h2>
  <p>
    A passphrase uses several random words instead of random characters. For example:
  </p>
  <p><code>candle-museum-harvest-piano</code></p>
  <p>
    This string is long, includes multiple words, and is easier to type than a jumble of characters. When generated randomly,
    the number of possible word combinations is huge.
  </p>
  <p>
    Passphrases are especially useful when you need to type a password on a phone or remember it temporarily. Just make sure the
    words are random, not meaningful phrases or quotes you invented yourself.
  </p>

  <h2>Where You Need the Strongest Protection</h2>
  <p>
    Not all accounts are equal. Focus your strongest passwords on:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Email accounts:</strong> Anyone who controls your email can reset many other passwords.</li>
    <li><strong>Banking and financial services:</strong> Obvious high-value targets.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud storage and photo backups:</strong> Sensitive personal information lives here.</li>
    <li><strong>Primary social media accounts:</strong> Losing these can damage your reputation and privacy.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Less critical sites—like discussion forums or newsletters—still deserve unique passwords, but the impact of compromise
    is usually smaller.
  </p>

<section>
  <h2>Putting It All Together</h2>
  <p>
    A realistic, secure setup for most people looks like this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use a password manager to store long, random passwords for every account.</li>
    <li>Generate new passwords with our generator or passphrase tool as needed.</li>
    <li>Turn on multi-factor authentication for email, banking, and other important services.</li>
    <li>Gradually replace old weak passwords using our <a href="/guides/upgrading-old-passwords">upgrade checklist</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Taken together, these steps dramatically reduce the chances that a single weak password will cause a serious problem.
