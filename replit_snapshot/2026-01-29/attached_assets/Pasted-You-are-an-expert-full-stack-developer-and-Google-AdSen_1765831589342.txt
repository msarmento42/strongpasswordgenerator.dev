You are an expert full-stack developer and Google AdSense policy consultant.

You are working in a Replit project that powers:

  https://strongpasswordgenerator.dev/

The site is a strong password generator with:
- A password generator
- A passphrase generator
- A password strength checker
- Guides / FAQ pages

Google AdSense has flagged the site for:
- "Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content"
- "Low value content"

We need to:
1) Turn the site into a small but complete content site (not just tools).
2) Integrate long-form content partials from `/content/*.html`.
3) Keep all existing functionality (generators, checker).
4) Use **AdSense Auto Ads** with publisher ID: `ca-pub-6175161566333696`.
5) Ensure **every page that includes the AdSense script is content-rich and looks finished** (no thin/test/placeholder pages).

--------------------------------------------------
CONTENT PARTIALS
--------------------------------------------------

Assume there is a `/content` folder containing the following HTML partials
(already created by me, with headings, paragraphs, lists, etc., but NOT full page shells):

- /content/home-main.html
- /content/passphrases-main.html
- /content/strength-checker-main.html
- /content/guides-hub.html
- /content/guide-strong-passwords.html
- /content/guide-password-managers.html
- /content/guide-upgrading-passwords.html
- /content/guide-mfa.html
- /content/faq.html
- /content/about.html
- /content/privacy.html
- /content/terms.html
- /content/contact.html

These files contain long-form, original content about passwords, passphrases, MFA, etc.
DO NOT rewrite or shorten their text. It is okay to:
- Wrap them in div/section containers
- Adjust heading levels for semantic correctness
- Add IDs / anchors

--------------------------------------------------
ROUTES & PAGE CONTENT
--------------------------------------------------

Inspect the existing project structure (whether it is static HTML, a template engine, or a small framework) and then create or update routes/pages so that:

1) Home: `/`
   - <title>: "Secure Password Generator | StrongPasswordGenerator.dev"
   - Contains:
     * The existing password generator UI and logic near the top.
     * Below the tool (or alongside it on desktop), inject the HTML from `/content/home-main.html`.
   - Ensure password generation is 100% client-side and uses secure randomness (e.g., `window.crypto.getRandomValues`).
   - Add clear comments in JS that generated passwords are never transmitted or stored.

2) Passphrases: `/passphrases`
   - <title>: "Passphrase Generator | StrongPasswordGenerator.dev"
   - Contains:
     * The existing or a new passphrase generator UI (options: number of words, separator, capitalization, etc.), implemented entirely client-side using secure randomness and a local wordlist.
     * The HTML from `/content/passphrases-main.html` below the tool.

3) Strength Checker: `/strength-checker`
   - <title>: "Password Strength Checker | StrongPasswordGenerator.dev"
   - Contains:
     * The existing password strength checker UI.
     * The HTML from `/content/strength-checker-main.html`.

4) Guides hub: `/guides`
   - <title>: "Guides & Resources | StrongPasswordGenerator.dev"
   - Contains:
     * HTML from `/content/guides-hub.html`
     * Internal links to each guide detail route below.

5) Guide detail pages:
   - `/guides/strong-passwords-and-passphrases`
       -> render `/content/guide-strong-passwords.html`
   - `/guides/password-managers`
       -> render `/content/guide-password-managers.html`
   - `/guides/upgrading-old-passwords`
       -> render `/content/guide-upgrading-passwords.html`
   - `/guides/multi-factor-authentication`
       -> render `/content/guide-mfa.html`

6) FAQ: `/faq`
   - Render `/content/faq.html`

7) About: `/about`
   - Render `/content/about.html`

8) Privacy Policy: `/privacy`
   - Render `/content/privacy.html`

9) Terms of Use: `/terms`
   - Render `/content/terms.html`

10) Contact: `/contact`
   - Render `/content/contact.html`
   - If there is a contact form, it can either:
     * Use a `mailto:` action, or
     * Call any existing backend endpoint.
   - Do NOT ever send generated passwords in any request.

Use whatever routing/layout mechanism the project is already using; the key is that each route renders a shared layout plus the correct content partial and (where relevant) the tool UI.

--------------------------------------------------
SHARED LAYOUT, NAVIGATION, FOOTER
--------------------------------------------------

Create or update a shared layout used by all main pages (e.g., base HTML template or root React component) with:

- <header> containing a <nav> with links to:
  - Password Generator (/)
  - Passphrases (/passphrases)
  - Strength Checker (/strength-checker)
  - Guides (/guides)
  - FAQ (/faq)
  - About (/about)
  - Privacy (/privacy)
  - Terms (/terms)
  - Contact (/contact)

- <main> where each page injects:
  - The tool UI (if applicable)
  - Then the proper `/content/*.html` partial

- <footer> with:
  - Copyright line
  - Links to About, Guides, Privacy, Terms, Contact

Accessibility & semantics:
- Exactly one <h1> per page.
- Use logical <h2>, <h3> levels for sections.
- Label form fields and buttons.
- Ensure layout is responsive (mobile-friendly, no horizontal scroll on narrow screens).

--------------------------------------------------
ADSENSE AUTO ADS INTEGRATION
--------------------------------------------------

We are using **Auto Ads only**, with publisher ID `ca-pub-6175161566333696`.

1) In the shared layout `<head>` (so every main page gets it), include this script:

   <!-- Google AdSense Auto Ads -->
   <script async
           src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-6175161566333696"
           crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

2) Remove any other existing AdSense code, including:
   - Any `<ins class="adsbygoogle">` elements.
   - Any inline scripts that manually push `(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push(...)`.
   - Any old page-level ads snippets.

   The **only** AdSense-related code should be the Auto Ads script above.

3) Make sure **every page that uses this shared layout is content-rich and looks finished**, thanks to the `/content/*.html` partials. There must be no:
   - Blank or nearly-blank pages with the script.
   - "Coming soon" / placeholder pages with the script.
   - Debug/test routes with the script.

4) If you find any routes that cannot be made substantial easily and are not essential, either:
   - Delete them altogether, OR
   - Ensure they do not use the main layout that includes the AdSense script (and do not appear in the sitemap).

--------------------------------------------------
PRIVACY, TERMS & POLICY COMPLIANCE
--------------------------------------------------

- Use `/content/privacy.html` as the body for the `/privacy` route.
  Ensure the page clearly states:
  - Passwords and passphrases are generated and checked client-side.
  - The site does not store or log generated passwords.
  - Third-party services (like Google AdSense Auto Ads) may set cookies and collect usage data as described in their own policies.

- Use `/content/terms.html` as the body for the `/terms` route.
  Ensure it includes:
  - Acceptable use of the site.
  - Disclaimers and limitation of liability.

- Footer must link to Privacy and Terms from every page.

--------------------------------------------------
SEO & TECH CLEANUP
--------------------------------------------------

1) For each route, set a relevant `<title>` and `<meta name="description">` reflecting that page’s content.

2) Create or update:
   - `/sitemap.xml` listing:
       /,
       /passphrases,
       /strength-checker,
       /guides,
       /guides/strong-passwords-and-passphrases,
       /guides/password-managers,
       /guides/upgrading-old-passwords,
       /guides/multi-factor-authentication,
       /faq,
       /about,
       /privacy,
       /terms,
       /contact
   - `/robots.txt` that allows normal crawling and references the sitemap.

3) Fix any JavaScript console errors or obvious issues.
4) In generator and checker JS files, add brief comments stating that all generation/checking is performed locally in the browser and no passwords are transmitted or logged.

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL SUMMARY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------

When you are done, output a concise summary that includes:

1) A list of the files you created or modified (with paths).
2) The final set of routes/pages and which content partial each one uses.
3) 3–5 bullet points explaining how these changes address:
   - "Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content"
   - "Low value content"

Do NOT rewrite the textual content inside `/content/*.html`. Focus on layout, routing, Auto Ads integration with `ca-pub-6175161566333696`, and ensuring every AdSense-enabled page has substantial, high-quality publisher content.
