You are an expert full-stack developer and Google AdSense policy consultant.

You are working in a Replit project that powers:

  https://strongpasswordgenerator.dev/

The site already has:
- A password generator (home page).
- A passphrase generator using the full EFF Large Wordlist as a static asset.
- A password strength checker.
- Guides and FAQ pages with long-form content.
- A functional contact form that uses a mailto: link.
- AdSense Auto Ads enabled via a global <head> script using publisher ID:
    ca-pub-6175161566333696

AdSense has previously flagged the site for
  "Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content / low value content".

You must keep all the existing functionality and content, but CHANGE how AdSense Auto Ads are loaded:

- Auto Ads script SHOULD run on content-rich, monetized pages.
- Auto Ads script SHOULD NOT run on non-content pages like Privacy, Terms, Contact, or any 404/utility pages.

--------------------------------------------------
PAGES & ROUTES (assume these already exist)
--------------------------------------------------

Content pages that SHOULD load Auto Ads:

1) `/` (home, Secure Password Generator)
2) `/passphrases`
3) `/strength-checker`
4) `/guides`
5) `/guides/strong-passwords-and-passphrases`
6) `/guides/password-managers`
7) `/guides/upgrading-old-passwords`
8) `/guides/multi-factor-authentication`
9) `/faq`

Non-content pages that SHOULD NOT load Auto Ads:

1) `/about`
2) `/privacy`
3) `/terms`
4) `/contact`
5) Any 404 / generic error page or internal-only utility/debug page.

These routes already render long-form content from `/content/*.html` partials and should remain as they are from a content/UI perspective.

--------------------------------------------------
CURRENT PROBLEM
--------------------------------------------------

Right now, the Google AdSense Auto Ads script is included in the GLOBAL <head> of the main layout/template, so it runs on ALL pages, including:

- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Use
- Contact
- Any 404/error page that uses the same layout

We need to refactor the layout so that:

- The Auto Ads script is only present on the monetized content pages listed above.
- The non-content pages render the same design but WITHOUT the Auto Ads script in their <head>.

This must be done in code, not just via AdSense dashboard, to act as a strong safeguard.

--------------------------------------------------
TASK: SPLIT LAYOUT INTO "WITH ADS" AND "NO ADS" VERSIONS
--------------------------------------------------

1) Inspect the project structure to find where the global HTML <head> is defined.
   Examples (depending on the stack):
   - A base HTML template (e.g., layout.html, base.html, index.html used as a shell).
   - A shared React/JSX layout component.
   - A common header/partial file.

2) Create TWO variants of this layout:

   a) Monetized layout (WITH Auto Ads)
      - Contains:
        * The normal <head> with title/meta tags.
        * The Google AdSense Auto Ads script:

          <!-- Google AdSense Auto Ads (monetized pages only) -->
          <script async
                  src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=ca-pub-6175161566333696"
                  crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

      - Used ONLY by the monetized content routes:
        `/`,
        `/passphrases`,
        `/strength-checker`,
        `/guides`,
        `/guides/strong-passwords-and-passphrases`,
        `/guides/password-managers`,
        `/guides/upgrading-old-passwords`,
        `/guides/multi-factor-authentication`,
        `/faq`.

   b) Non-monetized layout (NO Auto Ads)
      - Same visual structure (header/nav, footer, CSS/JS includes) but
        DOES NOT include the AdSense script at all.
      - Used by:
        `/about`,
        `/privacy`,
        `/terms`,
        `/contact`,
        404/error pages,
        and any internal-only/utility routes.

3) Implementation guidance (choose the correct approach for the stack):

   - If the project is plain static HTML with separate files per page:
     * Ensure pages like index.html, passphrases.html, strength-checker.html, guides*.html, faq.html
       include the Auto Ads script in their <head>.
     * Ensure about.html, privacy.html, terms.html, contact.html, 404.html (and similar) do NOT
       include the Auto Ads script.
     * Keep all other CSS/JS includes consistent.

   - If the project uses a template engine (e.g., a base layout with blocks):
     * Extract the Auto Ads script into a block/partial that is ONLY extended by the monetized templates.
     * Example: base.html without ads; monetized_base.html extends base and adds the Auto Ads script
       in the head block.
     * Point monetized routes at monetized_base.html and non-monetized routes at base.html.

   - If the project is a SPA/React app:
     * Identify the top-level layout component that manages <head> tags (plain HTML, React Helmet, etc.).
     * Implement a small helper that checks the current pathname and conditionally renders the Auto Ads script only when pathname matches one of the monetized routes listed above.
     * Make sure the script is NOT rendered at all on `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/contact`, or 404 routes.

4) Confirm that the Auto Ads script **no longer appears** in the page source for:
   `/about`, `/privacy`, `/terms`, `/contact`, and any 404 or utility pages.

--------------------------------------------------
KEEP ALL EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY
--------------------------------------------------

While refactoring the layouts:

- Do NOT remove or break:
  * Password generator functionality on `/`.
  * Passphrase generator with EFF wordlist.
  * Strength checker logic and UI.
  * Guides & FAQ content from `/content/*.html`.
  * Contact form mailto behavior.
  * Existing SEO meta tags (titles, descriptions, canonical if present).
  * Sitemap.xml and robots.txt configuration.

- All content should remain exactly as previously configured; only the presence/absence of the Auto Ads script should change per route.

--------------------------------------------------
OPTIONAL BUT RECOMMENDED COMMENT
--------------------------------------------------

In a main JS or template file, add a short comment explaining:

- Auto Ads script is intentionally only present on content-rich pages.
- Non-content pages (Privacy, Terms, Contact, etc.) use a no-ads layout for policy compliance.

--------------------------------------------------
FINAL SUMMARY OUTPUT
--------------------------------------------------

When you finish, output a concise summary including:

1) Which files were changed or created to split the layout (with paths).
2) Which routes now use the monetized layout (with Auto Ads script).
3) Which routes use the non-monetized layout (no Auto Ads).
4) A short explanation (3–5 bullets) of how this change helps avoid:
   - "Google-served ads on screens without publisher-content"
   - "Low value content" violations.

DO NOT change the textual content of `/content/*.html`. Focus on layout splitting and ensuring that AdSense Auto Ads only run on the specified monetized content pages.
