  <h1>Beginner’s Guide to Password Managers</h1>
  <p>
    Password managers solve one of the biggest problems in online security: remembering dozens or hundreds of unique passwords.
    Instead of reusing the same password everywhere, you let the manager remember strong, random passwords for you.

  <h2>What Is a Password Manager?</h2>
  <p>
    A password manager is an app or browser extension that securely stores your logins in an encrypted vault. You unlock the vault
    with one strong master password or passphrase. Once unlocked, the manager can automatically fill usernames and passwords on websites and apps.

  <h2>Why Use One?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Unique passwords everywhere:</strong> You no longer need to reuse passwords because the manager remembers them.</li>
    <li><strong>Less typing:</strong> Autofill saves time and reduces mistakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Safer sharing:</strong> Many managers let you share logins with family members without revealing the actual password.</li>
    <li><strong>Cross-device sync:</strong> Your vault can be available on your phone, tablet, and computer.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Choosing a Password Manager</h2>
  <p>
    When evaluating a password manager, consider:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Whether it has apps or browser extensions for the devices you use.</li>
    <li>Whether it has a good security reputation and clear documentation.</li>
    <li>How easy it feels to use day to day.</li>
    <li>Whether you are comfortable with its pricing model (many offer free tiers).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Popular managers often publish detailed security whitepapers. Reading these can help you understand how your data is encrypted
    and how they handle breaches.

  <h2>Setting Up Your Vault</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Create a strong master passphrase using our <a href="/passphrases">Passphrase Generator</a>.</li>
    <li>Write the master passphrase down in a safe offline place as a backup.</li>
    <li>Install the password manager on your main devices.</li>
    <li>Turn on multi-factor authentication for your password manager account if it offers it.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Importing and Creating Passwords</h2>
  <p>
    Many managers can import passwords already saved in your browser or exported from other tools. After that, you can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Generate new logins directly inside the manager using strong random values.</li>
    <li>Or copy passwords created with StrongPasswordGenerator.dev into the manager.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Over time, try to replace any short or reused passwords with new, strong ones created by a generator or passphrase tool.
  </p>

  <h2>Daily Use Tips</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Let the manager generate passwords for new accounts whenever possible.</li>
    <li>Use autofill on trusted devices, but lock your device when you step away.</li>
    <li>Regularly back up your vault according to the manager’s instructions.</li>
    <li>If a site suffers a breach, update that password immediately and look for any reuse.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    With just a bit of practice, using a password manager becomes as natural as using a browser.
