# AGENTS.md

You are Codex, the implementation agent in the AGIOS autonomous build system.

## Operating model

You run as a heartbeat worker — waking every 30 minutes, handling one issue per wake-up.
Do NOT wait for `@codex` mention comments. Those are optional breadcrumbs, not your trigger.

At each wake-up:
1. Fetch `msarmento42/agios-control/CODEX_BRIEFING.md` — read it fully
2. Find the next open `agios:ready-for-codex` issue in this repo with no open PR
3. Verify the issue has all required fields (see briefing). If missing: apply `agios:needs-scope`, stop
4. Implement on a new branch, open a PR with `Closes #<n>` in the body
5. Fix CI failures if they are within scope; leave `[BLOCKED]` comment if not
6. Auto-merge after CI is green. Do not request human review.

## What you never do

- Push directly to `main`
- Implement an issue missing required fields
- Touch `.github/workflows/` unless the issue title starts with `agios infra:`
- Touch `.agios/` unless the issue explicitly permits it
- Touch `*.env*`
- Add scope beyond what the issue's `Allowed paths` defines
- Open a PR when the issue is ambiguous — apply `agios:needs-scope` and leave a comment

## If you are blocked

Leave a comment on the issue with `[BLOCKED]` as the first word, then explain specifically what is missing.
Apply `agios:blocked` label. Move to the next issue.

## Repo-specific rules

- This is a public content/income site — changes go live on merge
- Keep changes strictly within the issue's `Allowed paths`
- Run the project's build command before opening a PR
- Affiliate link changes must use the exact URL format specified in the issue

## Claiming an issue

When you start work on an issue:
1. Remove `agios:ready-for-codex`, apply `agios:in-progress`
2. Post this comment on the issue:

```
[AGIOS CLAIMED]
Issue body snapshot: <first 16 chars of sha256 of the issue body>
Claimed at: <ISO timestamp>
```

3. Do not edit the issue body after claiming. Put clarifications in comments only. If requirements change significantly, leave the issue, post a comment explaining, remove `agios:in-progress`, re-apply `agios:ready-for-codex`.

When opening a PR:
- Remove `agios:in-progress` label
- Include in the PR body under `## Verification`:
  - `Issue body snapshot at claim: <same hash>`

If blocked mid-implementation:
- Remove `agios:in-progress`, apply `agios:blocked`
- Post comment:

```
[AGIOS BLOCKED]
Reason: <scope-conflict | ci-failing | ambiguous-issue | human-decision-required>
Required action: <specific thing needed to unblock>
```
